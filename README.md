# YTAudioBookmarklet
Some Youtube videos are just too quiet/loud. 

Even though the volume slider is all the way to the right, all the way to the left, sometimes it just ain't enough.

This bookmarklet is relatively simple: you press it, you get a pop-up asking you by how much to multiply the audio coming out of the youtube video. 

You input it - bada-bing, bada-boom, the audio for the current video is changed by that much. Voila!
